# Project Images Guide

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Your Images Are Not Showing

The project image files exist but are empty placeholders. You need to replace them with actual images.

## 📁 Current Status:
- ✅ Folder structure is set up correctly
- ✅ Image paths are configured properly  
- ❌ **Image files are empty - you need to add real images**

## 🖼️ Required Images:

Replace these empty files with your actual project images:

1. **`predictive-maintenance.jpg`** - For "Predictive Maintenance System"
2. **`clothes-classification.jpg`** - For "Clothes Classification using Deep Learning"  
3. **`lead-scoring.jpg`** - For "Lead Scoring with Logistic Regression"
4. **`prosper-loan-analysis.jpg`** - For "Data Analysis and Visualisations on Prosper Loan Dataset"

## 📋 Image Specifications:

### **Recommended:**
- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size:** 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio) 
- **File size:** Under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Quality:** High resolution but web-optimized

### **What to Use:**
- Screenshots of your project interfaces
- Data visualizations from your projects
- Charts or graphs from your analysis
- Code snippets with results
- Project architecture diagrams

## 🔧 How to Add Images:

1. **Find or create images** for each of your 4 projects
2. **Rename them exactly** as listed above
3. **Replace the empty files** in this folder
4. **Test locally** by running `npm run dev`

## 🎯 What Happens:

- **With real images:** Your projects will show beautiful custom backgrounds
- **Without images:** Placeholder SVG will show with "Project Image Placeholder" text

## 💡 Quick Tips:

- Use screenshots from your GitHub repositories
- Create simple graphics with project titles and tech stack
- Export charts/visualizations from your Jupyter notebooks
- Use Canva or similar tools to create project banners

## 🚀 Testing:

After adding images, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then check the Projects section to see your images!
